# A-Social-Media-Case-Study-on-Reddit-Scrapping

### Premise

Social media as defined by Merriam-Webster is “forms of electronic communication (such as websites for social networking and microblogging) through which users create online communities to share information, ideas, personal messages, and other content (such as videos)”. The biggest keys to social media are the ability to communicate and build community. Society today is relying on social media more than ever before for information on a variety of topics, from current events to how to get the most out of your pantry space.
This creates a large community that can post and comment frequently. Reddit can be broken down into pages called subreddits. Subreddits are pages that are about a particular topic and can be managed by an administrator and create a community of followers that can post and comment. There are many posts that turn into conversations about a particular topic that a post is about. For example, this project will look at two subreddits that are related to Disney. One of the subreddits is r/DisneyWorld, which has over 36,000 followers and the other subreddit is r/disney which has over 613,000 followers. 

### Problem Statement
<div align = 'center'>The analysis I will perform will be composed of multiple layers, however it will all be focused on the problem statement: How can a Social Media Analysis be beneficial a business?</div>

### Method
To perform a social media analysis, one must first do a process called web scraping to get the data from the website. For this project, the two subreddits mentioned above will be scrapped. Web scraping of Reddit allows the analyst to pull posts and comments from a subreddit page. To do this in Python like this project, analysts use the PRAW package. First, like most cites that would be scrapped, one must set up an account and get access to the data on the subreddits. Once that is done the data can be pulled from the cite.
